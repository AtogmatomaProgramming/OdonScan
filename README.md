### Result Screen

<p align="justify">
In the current version (1.0.0) the app can recognize two species: "bacaladilla"(left) and "gallo"(right). Using an online database hosted in Firestore, it displays key information (scientific name, description, regions where the species can be found, etc.) about the identified fish. regions where you can find it, ...) of the indetified fish.

</p>

- **Kotlin**: The primary programming language used to develop the Android app.
- **Android Studio**: The integrated development environment (IDE) for Android development.
- **Firebase Firestore**: Used to host and manage the database of marine species and their details.
- **TensorFlow Lite**: Utilized for the integration of machine learning models to recognize marine wildlife.
- **Glide**: For handling image loading and rendering in the app (if applicable).
- **GitHub**: For version control and collaborative development.

<p align="justify">
These technologies allow OdonScan to provide a smooth user interface, reliable species recognition, and the scalability needed for future updates.
